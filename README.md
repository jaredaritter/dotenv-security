# Securing private data

Requirements: Node.js

Use:

- Clone the repo and install the dependencies (it's only dotenv)
- Run 'node index.js' to log the test environment variable to the console.
- Alternatively you can use 'npm run no_require' to run a script that requires dotenv and sets the path through the command line.
- Both methods source from the same .env file in /obscuring_folder (the folder is not obscuring data, rather making the path other than root for learning purposes)

Caveats: Normally the .env file would not be available as source. It is present for demonstration purposes only.
