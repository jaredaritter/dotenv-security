Dependencies: Node.js

- Use: Run 'node index.js' to log the test environment variable to the console. Alternatively you can use 'npm run no_require' to run a script that requires dotenv and sets the path through the command line. Both source from the save .env file in /obscuring_folder

- Caveats: Normally the .env file would not be available as source. It is present for demonstration purposes only.
